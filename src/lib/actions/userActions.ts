// This file is intentionally left blank after removing all user authentication and management code.
// It can be safely deleted from the project.
// If any utility functions previously here were not strictly auth-related and are needed elsewhere,
// they should be moved to a more appropriate location (e.g., a general utils file).
// For now, all content related to user login, logout, fetching users, adding users,
// updating roles, and deleting users has been removed.
